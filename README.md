👋 Hi, I’m Nawaraj Paudel

As a highly experienced professional data scientist with 7+ years in the field, I have a deep understanding of data science, statistics, and machine learning. My current project involves using Deep Learning/classical ML methods to enhance battery performance/lifecycle. My previous work involved trend detection in next-generation NMR technology development to transform the health sector, as well as data analysis, modeling, and database principles.

I am proficient in using a range of programming languages, including Python (and R, MATLAB, SQL), to analyze big data, visualize results, and produce high-quality images for business and scientific publications in reputable journals.

As a Data Scientist and a former senior scientific staff member at National High Magnetic Field laboratory, I have developed strong leadership and mentorship skills through my responsibility of mentoring junior data scientists and experimental scientists. I am able to work effectively both independently and as part of a team, and have a track record of meeting strict deadlines by prioritizing tasks and adapting to changing priorities as needed.

I am proficient in using Python packages such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, as well as SQL, and have expertise in machine learning concepts such as regression, classification, Bayesian statistics, support vector machines, decision trees, and deep learning. I am always looking to expand my skillset and believe that adaptation, passion, and perseverance are key to success in this field.

🌱 I’m currently working on Battery Intelligence which aims to revolutionalize the battery performance with the use of ML/DL.

💞️ If you are looking for a data scientist/ data engineer/ ML engineer who is meticulous, a team communion, innovative, open to learning new techniques
