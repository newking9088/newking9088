- 👋 Hi, I’m Nawaraj Paudel
- I am a professional data scientist currently working on a trend detection in next-generation NMR technology development. I have a robust background and knowledge 
in statistics, algebra, programming and machine learning. In my past 7 years as an applied data scientist and computational research scientist in demand driven industry Research and 
Development, I have successfully implemented Python (R, MATLAB) to analyze big data and visualized them to output high quality images for business and scientific
publications in renowned journals. I atteneded several graduate specialized courses in Machine Learning while I was in school to begin with and gained hands-on 
experience on ML model development and Applied Python Programming through real projects and multitude of professional certifications ranging from Applied Python for
Data Scientist  to advanced concept of Machine Learning like gradient boosting algorithms, dimensionality reduction algorithms, logistic regression etc., to hone my skill.
When I was working as a scientific staff in a large research group with new undergraduates joining the summer research program every year, I was tasked to train and help formulate a
research program for 3 months, I have developed invaluable leadership and mentorship skills. I have proven my ability to work independently, as a strong collaborator in
team environment and meet strict deadlines by prioritizing work or changing priority as needed. I am well versed in using Python packages like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib,
seaborn, scikit, PyTorch, TensorFlow to name a few, SQL, and regression, classification, Bayesian statistics, support vector machines, decision tree, fine tuning etc.
concepts in machine learning. I am always open to learn new skills, and strongly believe that adaptation, passion, and perseverance are key to success.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on AWS Certified Big Data - Specialty and ML pipelines.
